This project will provide a Radiance exporter for Blender. Stability for the user, flexibility and a unique set of features are key aspects in the development.

[Documentation](ProjectIntro.md) is kept in the project wiki.

Installable zip packages will be provided with the first release in the [downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/brad2/downloads/list). Meanwhile you can get a snapshot of the current code via SVN.

Please be patient while we are working on the first release.
